# John Steed Puppet

This is the source code used in my John Steed Puppet project.

The original project is described here: [John Steed Puppet](https://web.archive.org/web/20190611032722/http://www.asciimation.co.nz/bb/2013/09/23/john-steed-puppet)

A YouTube film of the watch is available here: [John Steed marionette puppet](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4Qb-zH86X8)

This IS NOT a running project. It requires very custom, one-off hardware and uses external libraries not included here. This code is provided purely for interested parties to examine.
